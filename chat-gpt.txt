QUESTION:
i'm developing a flask application and i have a server sent events connection, though i don't want to create a for loop for each user to retrive the data needed from the database. I have two solutions:
1. Start a single for loop and caching the data retrived with flask-cache
2. Using Kafka to cache the data retrived
Which solution is better?

Between the two solutions you've mentioned, using Kafka to cache the data retrieved is generally the better option for handling real-time data in a Flask application with server-sent events. Here's why:

Using Kafka:
Advantages:

Scalability: Kafka is designed to handle high-throughput real-time data streams, making it suitable for serving multiple users concurrently without sacrificing performance.
Asynchronous processing: Kafka enables asynchronous processing, which means you can retrieve data from the database and publish it to Kafka without blocking the main application thread. This allows your Flask application to continue serving other requests efficiently.
Distributed caching: Kafka can be configured as a distributed caching mechanism, allowing multiple instances of your Flask application to share the same cache and work together to handle the load.
Flask-Cache:
Using Flask-Cache to cache data retrieved in a for loop may not be the most efficient solution, especially when dealing with multiple users and real-time data. It could lead to performance issues as the application's main thread will be occupied in retrieving and caching data for each user, potentially leading to delays and affecting the responsiveness of your application.

Keep in mind that Flask-Cache is typically used for caching static or infrequently changing data, and using it to cache data for real-time server-sent events might not yield the desired performance and scalability.

In contrast, Kafka is specifically designed for handling real-time data streams, making it a more suitable solution for this scenario. By using Kafka, you can decouple the data retrieval and caching process from the main application thread, allowing for better scalability and responsiveness.

Here's a potential approach using Kafka for caching real-time data:

Set up a Kafka topic to store the real-time market data.
Whenever new market data is retrieved from the database, publish it to the Kafka topic.
Have the server-sent events (SSE) connections subscribe to the Kafka topic.
When a user opens an SSE connection, stream the cached data from the Kafka topic to that user.
This way, your Flask application can handle multiple SSE connections efficiently, and new data can be instantly sent to all connected clients through Kafka without the need for manual caching in a for loop.

Remember that while Kafka can be a powerful solution, it also adds complexity to your application. Consider your specific requirements and the scalability needs of your application before making a decision. If the project is relatively small-scale and straightforward, and the number of users is limited, Flask-Cache might be sufficient for your needs. However, if you anticipate significant traffic and concurrent users, Kafka is likely to be the more appropriate choice.
