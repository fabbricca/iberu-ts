Hello everyone,

I came across this conversation and noticed that some of you might not be entirely comfortable with coding your own trading strategies. I understand that mastering a programming language to thoroughly backtest a strategy can be quite challenging. If anyone is interested and has a strategy (whether it's already coded or just an idea) I'd be happy to assist by performing free backtests.

Feel free to DM me if you're interested. I want to emphasize that the purpose of this service is purely educational and informational. The results are not intended for actual trading decisions without thorough personal research and analysis.

If you have any questions about the process or would like to learn more, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to help!

Best regards,
Iberu
